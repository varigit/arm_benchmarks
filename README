ARM Microprocessor (AM) Benchmarks project build instructions:

If building the project outside the ti-sdk environment that contains a rules.make, the user must modify the "DIRS" file.

These variables must be defined in the DIRS config file:
DESTDIR ?= < Must point to the install directory of the target file system >

NOTE:When setting paths, do not have any leading or trailing spaces in the path i.e. LINUX_DEVKIT_PATH=/home/user/fs/opt/arago-sdk

Below are the command line build options.
To Build: make all

This will build both the debug and release versions of the Matrix TUI project.

To Install: make install

This will install the binaries into DESTDIR defined in the makefile.init.

To clean: make clean

This will remove the objects and executables in the respective Debug and Release directories

To Build Debug only: make debug

To Build Release only: make release

To Install Debug only: make install_debug
